Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Seminars: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Objectives
----------

The methods and musical language that you use to compose music for this class will explore the resources of twentieth-century "post tonality." Within that general requirement—which we shall see through analysis, score reading and listening is extremely broad!—you are free to compose in any style and use any technique that you like.

Prerequisites
-------------

21M.304 or permission of the instructor.

Course Format
-------------

This seminar-style course meets once per week. It is offered every term, and can be repeated multiple times for credit. The relatively highly structured syllabus exemplified here is particularly suited to students who are new to post-tonal compositional techniques.

Composition Projects
--------------------

1.  **Melodic writing:** a work for unaccompanied melodic instrument
2.  **Counterpoint:** a work for two instruments with equal melodic weight
3.  **Melody and accompaniment:** a song using twentieth century or contemporary poetry as a text, for soprano and piano
4.  **Timber and rhythm:** a work for percussion
5.  **Variable texture:** a work for string quartet

Texts
-----

We will refer to chapters that deal with twentieth-century compositional technique in two books:

Benjamin, Thomas, Michael Horvit, and Robert Nelson. _Techniques and Materials of Music_. 7th ed. New York, NY: Schirmer, 2007. ISBN: 9780495189770.

*   Chapter 30, "Modes, Scales and Sets."
*   Chapter 33, "Ordered Segments and Serialism."
*   Chapter 35, "New Ways to Organize Rhythm, Meter, and Duration."

Clendinning, Jane Piper, and Elizabeth West Marvin. _The Musician's Guide to Theory and Analysis_. New York, NY: W.W. Norton, 2004. ISBN: 9780393976526.

*   Part IV, "Twentieth Century Materials." pp. 181-221.

You may own one of these texts from your previous music studies at MIT. The relevant chapters will also be provided in class; if you are new to post-tonal compositional technique you will find these chapters particularly helpful.

Listening
---------

We shall explore twentieth century and contemporary works in class, using scores and recordings. In addition, I ask that you immerse yourself in the music of our time on your own. As with language acquisition, immersion is a key to understanding and competence. Outside listening should include both recordings (with scores) and live concerts, with a weekly journal assignment as described in the [listening]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/listening) section.
